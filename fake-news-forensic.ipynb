Results & Discussion**\n\nThis section highlights the strengths and areas for improvement of the current system. By combining embeddings, a vector store, and an LLM, we demonstrate a practical pipeline for misinformation detection.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Observations**\n\n1. **Effective Retrieval**  \n   The system consistently retrieves fact-checks that are semantically similar to the user's claim. This shows the embedding model and FAISS index are working well for capturing conceptual similarity.\n\n2. **Grounded LLM Explanations**  \n   Because we explicitly provide supporting evidence (via top-k retrieved texts), the LLM's responses are more reliable and less prone to hallucination. The generated explanations often reflect the core sentiment and stance of the reference material.\n\n3. **Flexible Prompt Engineering**  \n   The prompt design (e.g., structured JSON, bullet points) can be customized to suit various output formats, improving downstream usability (e.g., in web apps, APIs, or analytics pipelines).\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ **Limitations**\n\n1. **Coverage Gaps in the Dataset**  \n   If a user provides a **novel claim** that isn’t closely aligned with the training data, the retrieval process may return irrelevant or weak matches. This limits the model’s ability to produce an accurate explanation.\n\n2. **Dependency on Original Labels**  \n   The system assumes the original labels (true/false) in the dataset are accurate. If those fact-checks are themselves outdated, biased, or incorrect, the LLM will inherit and reinforce those flaws.\n\n3. **Lack of Temporal Awareness**  \n   The system does not account for when a claim was made or verified. In reality, facts evolve (e.g., medical advice, political events), so a static dataset can lead to stale or misleading conclusions.\n\n4. **Limited to English (Default Setup)**  \n   The model and dataset used are English-only. Multilingual support would be required to scale this to global misinformation detection.\n\n---\n\n### 💡 **Suggestions for Users**\n\n- Try using **different queries** to test the system’s generalization.\n- Swap in other **LLMs** (like `gpt-4`, `Claude`, or local models via Hugging Face).\n- Adjust the **prompt** to change tone, style, format (e.g., tweet-length responses, long explanations, academic citations).\n- Plug in your **own dataset** to adapt the pipeline for domains like healthcare, education, or financial scams.\n\nThis is not a complete solution, but it’s a solid foundation that highlights how AI can assist in fact-checking workflows.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **8. Conclusion & Future Work**\n\nIn this notebook, we demonstrated how to build a **fact-checking pipeline** using:\n\n- **Sentence Transformers** for embeddings.\n- **FAISS** for vector similarity search.\n- **OpenAI’s** language model to generate concise, grounded explanations.\n\n### Possible Next Steps\n1. **Multilingual Support**: Incorporate models and data for different languages.\n2. **Real-Time Data**: Pull live content from social media or news APIs for on-the-fly fact checks.\n3. **Improved Prompt Engineering**: Use few-shot prompts or chain-of-thought to yield more rigorous explanations.\n4. **Deploy as an App**: Build a simple web or command-line interface to let users query claims interactively.\n\nFinally, **have fun experimenting**! Change the model, the vector database, or the prompt. This is just one example pipeline—the underlying approach can be adapted to many tasks beyond fake news detection.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Appendix: References & Acknowledgments**\n\n1. **ISOT Fake News Dataset**\n2.
